\`\`\`json
{
  "title": "Brief session title describing the main focus (max 5 words)",
  "summary": "Detailed markdown-formatted SOAP note with mandatory sections (see below)"
}
\`\`\`

## **QUALITY STANDARDS:**

### **For Title:**

### **For Summary:**

- Write in professional, clinical language appropriate for medical records
- Be specific and actionable rather than vague
